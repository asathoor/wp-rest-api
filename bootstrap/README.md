# Bootstrap

Here is a *Bootstrap* version of a site that could be used is connection with my *Headless Knight* theme - or as a stand alone somewhere. This is a web app that will fetch the content from WordPress by pure HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

The file *bootstrap-wf-content.html* is the version where content is fetched from my sandbox.
