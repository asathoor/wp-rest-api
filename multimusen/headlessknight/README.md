# WordPress Theme: The Headless Knight

## The version for Multimusen

## Installation

1. Zip the files.
2. Install the Theme via the WordPress Dashboard.
3. Edit the URL in index.php - let it point to your portfolio.

## Edit index.php

Change this line in your index.php - let it point to the folder whith your website:

~~~~
window.location = 'https://example.com/portfolio';
~~~~

Now we don't use a theme. Everything is made by HTML, CSS and javascript.

## Inspiration

This theme is inspired by Sufyan bin Uzayr's [article on Sitepoint: "WordPress Headless CMS"](https://www.sitepoint.com/wordpress-headless-cms/). However Uzayr's article omits an essential point: how to set up the theme on WordPress.

This theme is ready to go.
