# Child Theme

## Based on: Twentytwentyone

In this child theme you find:

## page-api-test.php

This is a costum page, that will load blog posts via the REST API. Note that you will get a page that will follow the general lay-out of the theme.

## api-test.html

If you link directly to this page from a web page the styles will work.
But if you link to the page via the WordPress menu all styles will be stripped.

Conclusion: a solution like this may cause a lot of frustration.

Recomended solution: don't place this type of files in the child theme folder.
