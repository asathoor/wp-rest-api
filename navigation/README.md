# Case: Portfolio - Navigation

*Navigare necessse est*

## The Navigation Panel

Minimalist navigation panel. Click a button, and get the relevant information from pages, posts or categories.

Only one button is active: "About Me".

*By thine own ingenium create buttons according the your will ...* (Inspired by Perdurabo)

### Or: filter your content

A panel like this could be relevant in a portfolio, where the content could be:

* About Me (a page)
* Resume (a page)
* Portfolio (category = portfolio in posts)
* Showcase (category = showcase in posts)

**Tip:** You can filter your content if you add categories, tags and taxonomies to your posts.
